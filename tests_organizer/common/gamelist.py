        <desc>The premise of Akuji the Heartless is not a happy one. Just as Akuji, a voodoo shaman, was about to get married, his bride-to-be was kidnapped and he was then killed by his very own brother. His seemingly loving sibling then ripped out his heart and sent Akuji to a dark and evil underworld. Akuji swore revenge on his brother and promised to avenge his true love.     As Akuji, you must collect the souls of your departed ancestors and give them to Baron Samedi, watcher of the underworld. If you are successful, he will grant your wish of revenge by giving you the opportunity to face your brother and do unto him as he did to you. More importantly, you will be together with your fiancee once again.    </desc>
